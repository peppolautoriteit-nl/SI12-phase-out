# Introduction

Standaardisatieplatform e-factureren (STPE) and the Netherlands Peppol Authority (NPA) have taken the initiative to investigate what is necessary to phase out SI-UBL 1.2 as invoice document type. This would mean that sending and receiving Peppol serviceproviders no longer exchange SI-UBL 1.2 documents on the Peppol network.

# Historically

In 2018, after the introduction of SI-UBL 2.0 / NLCIUS, there was already an initiative to phase out SI-UBL 1.2
Endusers and serviceproviders identified three main issues that prohibited all endusers from migrating to SI-UBL 2.0 or Peppol BIS3.
The issues identified at time were:
  1. Calculating VAT on invoice line level
  2. Using G-Accounts
  3. Rounding differences because of using multiple decimals

# Current

Many things have changed between 2018 and 2021. These changes include changes in SI-UBL 2.0, Peppol BIS3 and the European norm.
the creation/adoption of invoice extensions for SI-UBL 2.0, changes in the European norm and the implementation of country specific rules for Peppol BIS3.

# Actions

1. The NPA will remove SI-UBL 1.2 as a mandatory supported document type.
2. The NPA will extend the compliancy check to verify that all serviceproviders have stopped using SI-UBL 1.2
